# Exercise Recommendation Tool

## Introduction

This python program helps users find appropriate exercises. users can get exercise recommendations in two ways: Be shown exercises that are similar to one they like, or be shown a list of exercise based on the body part they would like to target.
The program uses pandas, Numpy, and Scikit learn to compare and recommend exercises.
